**European BioInvasions** is the first of two games developed as part of the EU-funded research projects InvaSiBES and AlienScenarios. These projects explore potential futures in Europe and how they might affect our ability to manage invasive alien species, as well as their impacts on native biodiversity. The aim is to understand effective management strategies for IAS across a range of species type (plants, mammals, insects and marine).

A Role-Playing Game aimed at expert and real life stakeholders that have to deal with invasive species, **European BioInvasions** covers multiple species and how we might manage them in different potential European futures. The invasion management strategies created during a successful workshop in Berlin 2022 using **European BioInvasions** were used to create the second of the games. A public outreach boardgame about the North American Raccoon in Europe, [**BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage**, (find out more about that game here)](http://paidia.design/).
