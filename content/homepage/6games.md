In European BioInvasions, the goal is to reduce the impact of invasive species. This is achieved by creating and passing Management Actions and adapting the approach to one of a set of scenarios that describe potential European futures.

The game is ‘coopetitive’ in nature, combining elements of collaboration and competition. It has been designed to be played by people knowledgeable in the topic of biological invasions, such as researchers, industry professionals and other stakeholders for the management of particular invasive species.

The game is run by one or two Game Masters (GMs) who guide the players through one out of a set of scenarios of plausible future circumstances in Europe (chosen by the GMs) with a focus on a particular invasive species. Each player assumes the role of a stakeholder, and jointly the players will generate new, and even innovative, strategies to manage the impact the species can cause.

European BioInvasions was a finalist in the International Educational Games Competition at the European Conference on Games Based Learning 2022 in Lisbon, Portugal.
