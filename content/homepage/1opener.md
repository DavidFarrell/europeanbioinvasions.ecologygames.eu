Drawing on research from EU-funded projects [*InvasiBES*](https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.50.35466) and [*AlienScenarios*](https://alien-scenarios.org), game designers and scientists worked together with policy makers to create games that explore invasive species management. 

Designed for groups of researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders (or ecology students), **European BioInvasions** is a role-playing game ideal to explore the issues of real-world ecological challenges and come up with new and novel solutions.

>I realized it was more effective to share my votes in different initiatives rather than only my own because I get to benefit from their outcomes too.
